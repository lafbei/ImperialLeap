1. Game Title

Industrial Leap


2. Elevator Pitch

Player manages a nations industry in 18-1900â€™s that will help his nation become more urbanized over time, and rich!


3. Theme and Concept

The world is our earth ca. 18-1900, players can expand, produce goods and trade with the global market.


4. Game Objective

The goal is to build up industry machine and earn as much cash as possible.


5. Core Gameplay Loop

Expand Nation -> Construct buildings -> Choose production methods -> Fill building input slots with required goods -> Produce goods -> Trade -> End turn.


6. Turn Structure

(Detail what happens during a player's turn, step-by-step.)

Start of Turn: Gain 2 Construction Cubes.

Warfare Phase: Player can spend Army Cubes along with credits to take a new building from a few available Rural Buildings, it comes already be built.

Colonization phase: Player can spend Navy Cubes along with credits to draw new random building from the Colonial deck and add it to his list of constructable buildings.

Construction phase: Player can spend Construction Cubes to build any Urban building, any Colonial building in hand and any Starting building in hand. 

Production Phase: Player takes goods from his warehouse and places them on the input slots of his buildings. Goods can only be put on input slot if it fulfils 100% of the input slot required goods need. Buildings can have multiple different production methods that each have different input requirements and output values. For example he needs to choose exactly 1 method from each production category the building has. He then exchanges his input goods for the output goods that he places in his warehouse. 

Trade phase: Player can trade with the global market, the buy and sell prices will be different depending on how many copies of the traded good are on the global market already. If there is none on the global market but the global supply has some then the player can still buy it but takes it from the supply instead paying the highest price noted on the Global market board for that kind of good.

End of Turn: Nothing
